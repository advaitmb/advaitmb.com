    <!-- Overview Section -->
    <div class="row pad10">
        <div class="content text">
            <p class="has-dropcap">In 2011, India's <strong>elderly population</strong> was 104 million, projected to
                double by 2050. Additionally, there were <strong>250 million illiterate adults</strong> and <strong>189
                    million with less than 5 years of schooling</strong>. This project focused on enhancing
                <strong>mobile banking services</strong> for these <strong>533 million 'emergent' users</strong>, a
                group new to information and communication technologies. <strong>Smartphone usage</strong> is rising in
                India, including among middle-income elderly and less educated populations. Despite widespread adoption
                of applications like WhatsApp, YouTube, and Hotstar, <strong>mobile banking</strong> remains
                inaccessible to emergent users. This gap necessitates their physical visits to banks, causing time
                wastage, overcrowding, and service limitations. We aimed to design a <strong>mobile banking application
                    interface</strong> tailored for elderly, illiterate, and less educated users. The focus was on
                <strong>audio-visual interfaces</strong> utilizing <strong>voice</strong> and <strong>touch
                    inputs</strong> and <strong>audio-visual outputs</strong>, aiming for a <strong>usable and
                    secure</strong> product.

            <span class="strange stretchable section">METHODOLOGY</span>
            <p style=" margin-top:0px">The project employed an <strong>iterative user-centered design process</strong>,
                adapting to the challenges posed by <strong>Covid-19 restrictions</strong>. We prototyped and evaluated
                the designs across <strong>three versions and four iterations</strong>, each based on user feedback. The
                initial design focused on key tasks like logging in, checking balance, reviewing statements, and
                conducting transactions, prioritizing <strong>simplicity</strong> and <strong>clarity</strong>. Due to
                the pandemic, <strong>remote and socially distanced interviews</strong> were conducted using specialized
                software and hardware setups. </p>

            <p>
                The evaluations involved <strong>elderly users</strong> and those with
                <strong>lower education levels</strong>, utilizing <strong>heuristic evaluations</strong>,
                <strong>localization</strong> in Hindi and Marathi, and <strong>formative evaluations</strong>. The team
                incorporated interfaces for browsing transactions, training videos, and <strong>in-app audio
                    prompts</strong> based on user feedback. A <strong>card sorting exercise</strong> was conducted to
                understand transaction categorization better. The final design was evaluated through a <strong>summative
                    evaluation</strong> with users of varying ages and education levels.

    <!-- Results Section -->

            <span class=" strange stretchable section">RESULTS</span>
            <p style=" margin-top:0px">The project's findings revealed several key insights. Firstly, about <strong>half
                    of the users</strong> could perform tasks without audio or video aids, while around <strong>90%
                    succeeded with either aid</strong>, highlighting the effectiveness of these supports. The
                <strong>color-coded passwords</strong> significantly aided users in identifying and inputting passwords
                correctly. The evaluations showed preferences for certain interface elements, like the arrangement of
                options and the use of <strong>audio prompts</strong> for better navigation. The study also highlighted
                the challenges users faced in understanding new concepts like <strong>QR codes</strong> and
                <strong>transaction categories</strong>. The final design incorporated these learnings, offering a
                <strong>simplified interface</strong> with clear instructions, multiple views for account information,
                and standardized, <strong>color-coded PINs and passwords</strong>. The project concluded with
                recommendations for deployment, emphasizing the need for <strong>simplified interfaces</strong>, focus
                on <strong>UPI payments</strong>, and support for <strong>audio and video aids</strong> to enhance
                usability for emergent users.
