    <!-- Overview Section -->
    <div class="row pad10">
        <div class="content text">
            <p class="has-dropcap"><strong>Low-income individuals</strong> often face constraints in skill
                development
                due to long working hours for low wages. This dynamic perpetuates a cycle where the need for
                immediate
                income limits opportunities for upskilling in vital areas like financial literacy, which could
                otherwise
                catalyze their <strong>upward economic mobility</strong>. Recognizing the potential of
                <strong>crowdwork</strong> as a growing labor sector in India, our study aimed to explore whether it
                could serve as a conduit for financial education. Specifically, we investigated if low-income
                individuals could acquire essential financial concepts while earning supplemental income through
                generating <strong>speech data</strong> in <strong>Marathi</strong>, a language spoken by a large
                community yet considered low-resource in language technology.
            </p>
            <p>We worked with a <strong>Marathi-speaking stone quarry worker community</strong> in Wagholi, a
                semi-urban
                area near Pune, India. The project's centerpiece was a <strong>nine-module financial literacy
                    curriculum</strong>, delivered through a <strong>smartphone app</strong> in a
                <strong>story-based
                    format</strong>. This method, grounded in an '<strong>education-through-entertainment</strong>'
                approach, was designed to engage workers as learners, ensuring their active involvement while
                imparting
                crucial financial concepts. Each lesson was accompanied by <strong>comprehension quizzes</strong>
                and
                open-ended questions to encourage self-reflection on the learned concepts. The <strong>two-week-long
                    financial literacy program</strong> was implemented using the <strong>Karya digital work
                    platform</strong>, allowing us to record pre- and post-intervention financial knowledge of the
                participants. In addition to evaluating the intervention's educational efficacy, we also assessed
                the
                <strong>quality of the speech data generated</strong>.

    <!-- Methodology Section -->
    <div class=" row pad10">

            <span class="strange stretchable section">METHODOLOGY</span>
            <p style=" margin-top:0px">Our study employed a mixed-method approach to assess the impact of a
                <strong>financial literacy
                    program</strong> on a community of stone quarry workers in <strong>Wagholi, Pune</strong>. We
                collaborated with <strong>Parinaam Foundation</strong>, <strong>Santulan</strong> (a local NGO
                working
                for the rights of the stone quarry community in Pune) and <strong>Karya</strong>, a digital work
                platform, to develop and deploy a <strong>Marathi-based financial literacy curriculum</strong>. We
                developed a <strong>novel framework</strong> for learning through <strong>data annotation</strong>
                of
                domain-specific data. Our work began with conducting <strong>contextual inquiries</strong> at
                financial
                literacy workshops in <strong>Bangalore</strong>. The insights gained were pivotal in
                <strong>designing
                    and adapting</strong> the curriculum for a digital work task. This process was critical in
                ensuring
                a balance between the <strong>annotators' needs</strong> and the <strong>quality of data</strong>
                collected.
            </p>
            <img src="img/microsoft1.png" alt="Payment distribution at the end of the study" class="projectImage">
            <p>The curriculum, developed using the <strong>Sabido Methodology</strong>, was story-based and
                focused
                on
                core financial concepts. Participants engaged with the curriculum through the <strong>Karya
                    platform</strong>, reading and recording sentences from the modules, which also facilitated
                the
                generation of valuable <strong>labelled speech data</strong>. Each module was followed by a
                <strong>comprehension quiz</strong> and open-ended questions, enabling revision and reflection
                of
                the
                content participants had engaged with. We recruited <strong>55 participants</strong>,
                emphasizing
                those
                with low levels of financial knowledge. The study utilized a <strong>within-subject pre-post
                    test
                    design</strong> for 55 participants, complemented by <strong>semi-structured
                    interviews</strong>
                with 14 participants post-intervention. This <strong>mixed-methods approach</strong> enabled us
                to
                quantitatively measure program efficacy and qualitatively understand participant responses. The
                efficacy
                was gauged through tests consisting of <strong>MCQs</strong> related to each module,
                administered
                before
                and after the program. Additionally, <strong>comprehension tests</strong> and <strong>task
                    completion
                    metrics</strong> were analyzed to assess participant engagement and learning progress.

            <span class=" strange stretchable section">RESULTS</span>
            <p style=" margin-top:0px">The results of our study were highly promising, demonstrating a substantial
                impact on
                <strong>financial
                    literacy</strong> among participants. On average, there was a <strong>41.6% improvement</strong>
                in
                participants' knowledge of financial concepts following the intervention. This significant increase
                was
                further evidenced by <strong>high scores in comprehension tests</strong>, where participants
                achieved an
                average of <strong>82.5%</strong>, indicating a strong grasp of the material they engaged with. The
                intervention not only enhanced their understanding but also fostered a sense of community among the
                participants, as observed through behaviors like <strong>peer support and knowledge
                    sharing</strong>.
                Additionally, interviews conducted post-intervention suggested a shift in participants'
                <strong>financial behaviors</strong>, moving towards more informed and responsible financial
                practices.
                Notably, our findings highlighted the dual motivators driving participant engagement in the project:
                the
                <strong>intrinsic value of learning</strong> new and important skills and the <strong>extrinsic
                    benefit
                    of financial incentives</strong>. These results underscore the effectiveness of integrating
                <strong>educational content</strong> into crowdwork platforms, particularly in the realm of
                financial
                literacy.
