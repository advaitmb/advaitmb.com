            <p class="has-dropcap"><strong>The project aimed at translating traditional therapy techniques for teaching
                    prepositions to children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) into a playful activity. This project
                    was motivated by the lack of playful therapy interventions in local languages that could be
                    effectively carried out at home by parents. The project explores how to create engaging, effective
                    activities that children with ASD can enjoy while learning essential language skills.</p>

            <span class="strange stretchable section">CONCEPT GENERATION</span>
            <p style=" margin-top:0px">The concept generation process involved three stages:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Identifying the Need</strong>: Based on primary field studies, including observations and
                    interviews, key challenges in conducting home therapy were identified. These included children's
                    lack of interest, parental misunderstanding of ASD therapy, and the difficulty of integrating
                    therapy into daily routines.</li>
                <li><strong>Analyzing Existing Techniques</strong>: A thorough review of current therapy techniques and
                    preferred activities of children with ASD was conducted. This review highlighted a gap in existing
                    serious games and activities focusing on preposition skills.</li>
                <li><strong>Ideation and Conceptualization</strong>: Drawing from the insights gained, three initial
                    concepts were developed:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Cat Goes Home</strong>: An iPad-based interactive story game.</li>
                        <li><strong>Build-a-Castle</strong>: A 3D tabletop block-building activity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Zoo Frenzy</strong>: An environmental interaction activity involving a treasure
                            hunt-like game.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Each concept was designed to incorporate intrinsic and extrinsic reinforcements, prompting
                    mechanisms, and direct or indirect instruction with prepositions.

                </li>
            </ol>

            <span class=" strange stretchable section">FINAL DESIGN</span>
            <p style=" margin-top:0px">After expert evaluation and integrating feedback, the final design centred on an
                interactive toy called "<strong>Clumsy Turtle</strong>." This design utilized environmental interactions
                and was crafted to be engaging and educational.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Design Components</strong>: The toy consists of a soft turtle toy with a detachable shell.
                    The shell's location is hidden by the parent, and the child must find it based on audio prompts from
                    the turtle. The difficulty level can be adjusted through prompt levels.</li>
                <li><strong>Therapeutic Integration</strong>: The activity mirrors traditional therapy progressions,
                    gradually increasing in difficulty as the child masters each skill. The design ensures the
                    maintenance of therapeutic efficacy while making the activity fun and engaging for the child.</li>
                <li><strong>Prototype Details</strong>: The prototype includes a hand-stitched turtle soft toy with
                    integrated electronic components like Hall effect sensors, audio recording and playback modules, and
                    an Arduino microcontroller for prompt control and playback.</li>
            </ul>
