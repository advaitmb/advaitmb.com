            <p class="has-dropcap">The project explores the interaction between
                <strong>writers</strong> and <strong>next-phrase suggestion systems</strong>, a technology increasingly
                used in <strong>writing interfaces</strong> like <strong>Google Smart Compose</strong>. These systems
                offer <strong>real-time phrase suggestions</strong> as the
                writer types, influencing <strong>writing style</strong> and <strong>content</strong>. Despite
                technological advancements in <strong>natural language processing</strong> enabling these interfaces,
                understanding of their <strong>impact</strong> on writers is limited.
            </p>
            <p>Our study focuses on the <strong>cognitive aspects</strong> of writing in the presence of
                <strong>suggestion systems</strong>. Utilizing the <strong>Hayes Cognitive Process Writing
                    Model</strong>, we examine how writers interact with these <strong>technologies</strong> and the
                <strong>cognitive processes</strong> involved. We investigate the influence of suggestion systems on
                <strong>writing</strong>, particularly how <strong>misalignments</strong> between the system's
                <strong>sentiment</strong> and the writer's <strong>opinion</strong> impact this interaction.
            </p>
            <p>For our research, we selected a <strong>movie review task</strong>, employing a suggestion system based
                on <strong>GTP-2</strong> fine-tuned on the <strong>IMDb movie reviews corpus</strong>.
                <strong>Participants</strong> were asked to write reviews for two movies, once with the suggestion
                system <strong>enabled</strong> and once <strong>without</strong>, while expressing their
                <strong>personal opinions</strong> and <strong>thinking aloud</strong>. Through <strong>qualitative
                    coding</strong> of <strong>think-aloud</strong> and <strong>retrospective protocols</strong>, we
                analyzed the <strong>complex interactions</strong> between writers and the suggestion system.
            </p>
            <p>Our findings reveal that writers engage with <strong>suggestions</strong> in <strong>multifaceted
                    ways</strong>, often incorporating parts of a suggestion even when they disagree with its overall
                sentiment. The system influenced the <strong>writing process</strong>, altering <strong>writing
                    plans</strong> and causing <strong>distractions</strong>, among other effects. We propose a model of
                <strong>writer-suggestion interaction</strong> and discuss
                how suggestion systems can be <strong>analyzed</strong> through this model. We also outline potential
                <strong>research directions</strong> and <strong>design opportunities</strong> for such systems,
                emphasizing their impact on the <strong>cognitive writing process</strong>.

            <span class="strange stretchable section">DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF AN LLM-POWERED TEXT EDITOR</span>
            <p style=" margin-top:0px">We developed a <strong>predictive text editor</strong> with next phrase
                suggestions and word completion capabilities for conducting the study. The editor provides suggestions
                when the user pauses for more than 300ms while typing. Suggestions appear either in-line or as a box
                near the cursor, depending on the text position. Users can select words using the tab key, choosing any
                number of words from the offered suggestion. We enhanced the design iteratively, initially presenting
                the entire phrase as a selection, but later allowing single-word selections for better user convenience.
                To differentiate between user text and suggestions, we used distinct styling and added interpuncts
                between words in the suggestion phrase.</p>
            <img src="img/full_editor.gif" alt="Payment distribution at the end of the study" class="projectImage">
            <p>The final interface included a timer and a submit button for user convenience and data collection. The
                text editor was developed using a <strong>Flask back-end</strong> and <strong>JQuery front-end</strong>.
                It sends keypress requests to the server, which computes the suggestions and returns them within 300ms.
                The system processes the last 50 words typed by the user for generating suggestions. Our server setup
                included a <strong>NVIDIA Tesla K80 card</strong> and an <strong>Intel Xeon E5-2690 v3
                    processor</strong> with 56 GB RAM, hosted in the Azure server ecosystem.</p>
            <p>For text prediction, we used a <strong>GPT2 transformer model</strong>, fine-tuned on an <strong>IMDb
                    movie review corpus</strong>. This fine-tuning was done for three epochs, achieving specific
                perplexity scores for positive and negative models. The <strong>Hugging Face transformers
                    library</strong> was used for training, and the <strong>beam search algorithm</strong> for
                generating phrase suggestions.</p>
            <p>We conducted <strong>sentiment validation</strong> using a pre-trained <strong>BERT Sentiment
                    Classifier</strong> to check the bias inheritance of our models. This involved generating phrase
                completions for prompts from the test set and analyzing the completed sentences through the BERT model.
                The logit scores indicated successful bias inheritance in our models.</p>
            <p>In the text editor, suggestion behavior varied based on the alignment with the writer's sentiment. We
                categorized these into exact alignment, slightly opposite alignment, and misalignment, demonstrating how
                the suggestion system interacted with the writer's intentions. This behavior was crucial for
                understanding the impact of predictive text editors on the writing process and user experience.</p>

            <span class=" strange stretchable section">RESULTS</span>
            <p style=" margin-top:0px">The findings from our study provide valuable insights into how writers interact
                with next-phrase suggestions in a predictive text editor. We observed that writers utilize suggestions
                in multiple nuanced ways, even when they do not directly accept them. Writers engaged with the
                suggestions at various levels:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Proposing (Idea Generation):</strong> Writers used suggestions to generate new ideas,
                    incorporating elements from the suggestions into their own thought processes.</li>
                <li><strong>Translating (Language):</strong> The suggestions influenced the language used by the
                    writers. They often abstracted and extracted specific parts of the suggestions to enhance their
                    language.</li>
                <li><strong>Transcribing (Typing Aid):</strong> Suggestions served as a typing aid, helping writers to
                    articulate their thoughts more efficiently.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A critical aspect of the interaction was the evaluation process. Writers employed various criteria to
                assess the suggestions, with the degree of alignment between the writer's intent and the suggestion's
                content significantly influencing this evaluation. Misalignment between the writer's perspective and the
                suggestion system played a major role, impacting not only the acceptance of suggestions but also the
                overall writing process.</p>
            <p>We also noted several effects of the suggestions on the writing process:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Change in Writer's Overall Plan:</strong> The presence and content of suggestions led to
                    alterations in the writers' original plans for their compositions.</li>
                <li><strong>Increased Distraction:</strong> Continuous evaluation of suggestions often caused
                    distractions, affecting the writers' focus and flow of thoughts.</li>
                <li><strong>Role of Misalignment:</strong> The degree to which the suggestion system's output aligned
                    with the writers' viewpoints was crucial. Misalignment led to increased scrutiny and rejection of
                    suggestions, influencing the writing process's direction.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Based on these findings, we propose a model of writer-suggestion interaction. This model outlines the
                ways in which writers interact with suggestions and offers a framework for future research and design of
                predictive text editors. The model underscores the complexity of writer-suggestion interactions and
                highlights the need for considering multiple facets of the writing process in designing and analyzing
                suggestion systems.</p>
